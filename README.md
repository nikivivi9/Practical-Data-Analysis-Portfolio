## Project 1: An Exploratory Data Analysis on Environmental Condition and Marathon Performance

### Project Description
This project a collaboration with Dr. Brett Romano Ely and Dr. Matthew Ely from the Department of Health Sciences at Providence College, aims to analyze the impact of environmental conditions on marathon performance, focusing on the interaction between age, gender, and weather-related factors. Using a dataset collected from five major U.S. marathons—Boston, Chicago, New York City, Twin Cities, and Grandma’s over a period of 15-20 years, the study investigates how variables such as Wet Bulb Globe Temperature (WBGT), solar radiation, relative humidity, wind speed, and air quality influence marathon runners' performance.

The performance outcome is measured as the percentage deviation from the course record (%CR), and the analysis is stratified by age and gender. The project also incorporates a new classification of age groups to better reflect the distribution of marathon participants. Through exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling, the project explores how environmental conditions impact performance differently across age groups and genders, with a particular focus on understanding the sensitivity of younger and older runners to these conditions.

### Methods
This report is a collaboration with Dr. Brett Romano Ely and Dr. Matthew Ely from the Department of Health Sciences at Providence College, which explores how environmental conditions, age, and sex would influence runner’s performance in this long-distance race. Their prior research found that warmer temperature leads to decline in performance in marathon races, and this decline in endurance performance varies significantly between females and males. Moreover, older adults face more thermoregulatory challenges during exercise, which further exacerbate performance declines under warmer temperature. This exploratory analysis study aims to build on previous findings, providing deeper insight by investigating the intersection of age, sex, and environmental conditions on runners’ marathon performance.

### Results

Through exploratory data analysis and statistical modeling, we concludes that age plays a significant role in runner’s performance. Highest, Upper-mid, and younger, aged runners perform worse, especially for senior in the highest age group. Moreover, male runners show more sensitivity to age change compared to female runners, with a steeper decline in
performance as age increases. Environmental conditions like Wet Bulb Global Temperature (WBGT), relative humidity (rh), and solar radiation (SRWm2) show statistically significant effect on people’s performance where WBGT has the largest impact with smaller p-value and larger coefficient estimates. Wind speed (Wind) and air quality (aqi) do not significantly affect runner’s performance. Despite the significance of these factors, people in the highest, upper-mid, and younger age group consistently show more fluctuations as environment changes compared to people in the lower-mid and mid age group. In addition, female runners exhibit more stable performance compared to male runners within the same aging group. The full report can be found [here](Project1/Report/Project-1-Codebook.pdf).
